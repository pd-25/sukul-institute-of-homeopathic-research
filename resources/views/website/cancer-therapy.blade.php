                <p><b>According to Wikipedia “Mistletoe is the common name for most obligate hemiparasitic plants in
                        the order Santalales. These plants attach to and penetrate the branches of a tree or shrub
                        by a structure called the haustorium, through which they absorb water and nutrients from the
                        host plant.</b></p>
                <p><b>The name mistletoe originally referred to the species Viscum album (European mistletoe, of the
                        family Santalaceae in the order Santalales); it was the only species native to Great Britain
                        and much of Europe. A separate species, Viscum cruciatum, occurs in Southwest Spain and
                        Southern Portugal, as well as North Africa, Australia and Asia.”</b></p>
                <p><b>In homeopathy, this medicine is often used in the name of “Viscum album”.</b></p>

                <h3>Why use Mistletoe?</h3>
                <p>Proponents say that mistletoe stimulates the immune system of our body and thereby, letting our
                    body to fight against cancer and other diseases. The immune system gets destroyed once there is
                    malignancy in our body. It has been reported that mistletoe extracts have long been successfully
                    used as a remedy in various types of cancers including cancer of the cervix, ovaries, breasts,
                    lungs, liver, pancreas, kidneys, stomach, and colon and also as a treatment for sarcoma,
                    lymphoma and leukemia. It has also been reported that mistletoe extracts injected directly or
                    near a tumor may sometimes slower the growth rate, even in advanced malignancy. Moreover it
                    reduces the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and thereby provides a better
                    quality of life to the cancer patient.</p>

                <h3>Evidence behind…</h3>
                <p>Laboratory studies have found that mistletoe kills cancer cells and stimulates the immune system.
                    Scientists working on mistletoe have able to identify the most important component in mistletoe
                    is lectins or proteins. A series of experiments have suggested that mistletoe may have some
                    potential to kill cancer cells but these results have yet to be reflected into human trials.
                    There have been clinical trials resulted into marked improvement in the survival of cancer
                    patients, although the experimental design had some flaws. More rigorous research studies are
                    needed. </p>
                <h3>Undesired effects and cautions</h3>
                <p>Raw, unprocessed mistletoe is poisonous. Eating raw, unprocessed European mistletoe or American
                    mistletoe may cause vomiting, seizures or showering the heart rate.</p>
                <p> The commercial mistletoe available in injections is made by the complementary pharmaceuticals in
                    Germany and those extract are considered to be safe when used according to the product
                    directions and under the supervision of a health care provider.</p>
                <p> Mistletoe injection may sometimes cause itching with redness around the area of the injection.
                    Less commonly side effects may include more extensive skin reactions, low grade fever, flu-like
                    symptoms. </p>
