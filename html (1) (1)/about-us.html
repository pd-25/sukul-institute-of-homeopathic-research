<p><b>Introducing online Homeopathy training/course for the homeopathy doctors and homeopathy students... a joint initiative of Sukul Institute of Homeopathic Research (SIHR) with North West College of Homeopathy, England</b></p>

<p>Sukul Institute of Homeopathic Research (SIHR), Kolkata, India is a registered Institute under Government of West Bengal under West Bengal Act XXVI of 1961, has been conducting laboratory based research in its Santiniketan Laboratory, since 2000 in association with Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan. SIHR has also technical association with Bose Institute, Kolkata. We regularly do experiments using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) at Bose Institute. Previously, we used to study Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) of homeopathic dilutions at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The modern day research in homeopathy is spreading throughout the world and scientists from different fields like biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computations have engaged themselves to unravel the complex science of homeopathic dilutions.</p>
<p>Sukul Institute now joined its hands with the North West College of Homoeopathy (NWCH) in Manchester, England to enter into the homeopathy education and to open up few online courses for the homeopathy doctors and also for the non medical personnel. Opportunity of studying homeopathy with the UK will always give you an elegant flavor to your practice life of homeopathy. Homeopathy in the UK is widely practiced and studying homeopathy there means, following a strict methodology of learning process.</p>

<div class="col-lg-7">
<p>It is not always possible for every one of us to fly to the UK, stay there and study homeopathy. But in today’s era of advanced technology, we have been able to succeed to hold the globe, sitting in our reading room. Thus for the very first time in our history, we the North West College of Homeopathy in England has entered into the distance learning of homeopathy.</p>
<p>North West College has its one year foundation course and 4 years professional course on homeopathy to offer in the College, itself here in England.</p>
<p>The International Diploma in Homeopathy leading to DipUKHomeo certification is a six months online course meant for the homeopathy doctors and students and its syllabus or modules are specially designed to strengthen the daily clinical practice. Not all homeopaths are successful and a successful homeopath has no competitors around. Through the completion of our International Diploma, we shall show you the path of the success and of course, you do not know where homeopathy can reach you. The success in your daily practice will not only give you the opportunity to earn more money and have more fame, but you will be delighted within you, once you will be able to cure a complicated disease and put smile to your patient. Remember, curing just one complicated case will give you ten times more than curing hundreds cases of cough/fever.</p>

<p>Practicing homeopathy is a very difficult task and there are several factors associated with the successful cures. Selection of right remedy, right potency at the right time, the duration of the application of the 2nd potency/remedy, identifying miasmatic block to remove and several others factors depend on a successful cure of a disease. Our International Diploma course is specially emphasized on these areas.</p>
<p>The North West College of Homoeopathy has its heart in the city of Manchester, England, but has already regularly served students from Spain to Scotland through its teaching centre in Manchester. Our Continuing Professional Development has attracted interest from homoeopaths in Australia and New Zealand. We celebrate our contribution to homeopathy through the second generation UK Indian and Pakistani adults we have helped to grow as professional English homoeopaths who still honour their distinctive heritage. Because of our commitment to all our students to become the homoeopath they are meant to be, we accommodate comfortably differences of approach and belief. Our bedrock is a clear understanding of fundamental principles and their practical application in the clinic.</p>
<p>We offer a one year foundation course and four year professional training from our base in England. Graduates of the four year course are immediately able to practice professionally, having fulfilled all clinical criteria as well as academic requirements. For us, the two are always integrated, a distinctive strength of the College throughout its 30 years of operation. As a result our course is recognized as a centre of excellence by our national accrediting body.</p>
<p>The College’s motto is Hahnemann’s own: “Dare to be Wise!” Hahnemann identifies the elements of wisdom as insight, awareness, discernment and knowledge. For a number of years, we have been eager to develop online material, but aware that the internet is a valuable tool for sharing knowledge (and nonsense too, of course!), but is less suited to sharing insight, awareness and discernment. Through the design of our course in content and assessment, we are hoping to make strides in developing a course which embraces insight, awareness and discernment and challenges participants to be wise.</p>
